\Abstract{
	What if the fast development of computer science, especially machine learning could help disabled people? In fact, it can and this is the topic to which the research described in this paper has been devoted. Deaf-mute people are the part of our society and it would be a great convenience both for them and speaking people which would allow for a better communication using technology. In this paper, the results of research concerning recognition of sign language has been shared. The research includes experimenting with the images transformations and usage of different learning and features detecting algorithms to obtain the best quality of signs recognition. In addition the part of this work has been also the impact of background and different hands rotation on accuracy.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

	Nowadays, using technology to solve medical issues is becoming a common practice[]. Constant and fast development of science and growing popularity of machine learning allow for creating technologically advanced appliances and complex algorithms which are aimed at helping people. Sign language recognition is an interesting and significant issue strictly connected with both machine learning and medical technology. Deaf-mute people pose X\% of the whole society[]. In the past there were no technical possibilities to facilitate their lives and communication ways. Now it is still challenging but possible so we attempted to solve this issue. 

	In this work we decided to experiment with different features extraction and learning algorithms and pay particular attention on image processing. Moreover the scope of this work includes also checking the impact of background and hands rotations on received accuracy based on usage 2 completely different data sets.
	
	Our approach to this problem at the current stage is based on recognition of single letters from American sign language alphabet. One of the crucial assumptions of this work is recognition of images taken with average-quality camera because the algorithm which has been implemented should be available for everyone for example by a build-in camera in mobile phone or computer.

\section{PROBLEM FORMULATION}

	The objective of this work is to create an algorithm which recognizes static gestures of single letters from American sign language alphabet with the highest possible accuracy. The algorithm should be given an image in .jpg format on input and the result should be returned as recognized letter on string type. To implement the algorithm, it is necessary to consider the problems as follows:
	
* finding crucial features and point on the picture

* emphasizing of hand features
	
* finding satisfying way of learning the algorithm.

\section{ALGORITHMS}

	In this section, the algorithms used in this work are being

	\end{figure} 

\subsection{Preprocessing}
	
	To prepare the set of images and improve received results Gaussian blur and anisotropic filtering has been used. Gaussian blur is a method of modification the image with Gaussian function. It is commonly used to reduce image noise and reduce details. Anisotropic filtering is a technique of enhancing the image quality... nie wiem co tu napsiac o tym, trzeba poczukac odwolania do czegos madrego o tym. In our work we used Gaussian blur to avoid recognition of unimportant and excess points which potentially could be found by the algorithm. At the same time, to sharpen the shape of hand and to not lose the main shape of the gesture anisotropic filtering has been applied.

	\end{figure}

\subsection{Features extraction}

In this research, three different features extractors from \textit{ski-image} library has been used. The purpose of using many extractors was finding the best one in this specific problem. Used feature extraction algorithms are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{CENSURE}\cite{CENSURE} - the newest algorithm from all used in the experiment. Its undeniably biggest advantage is fast computing time which makes him an aspiring one to be appropriate for our goal. Unfortunately CENSURE is able to find only key points but not descriptors on the picture. To retrieve the descriptors, some other descriptors extractor has to be used. In our implementation descriptors has been acquired with usage of BRIEF. 
	
	\item \textit{BRIEF}\cite{BRIEF} - Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features is an efficient feature point descriptor. It is highly discriminative even when using relatively few bits and is computed using simple intensity difference tests[]. The main disadvantage of this extractor is its inability to sensible dealing with images rotations.
	
	\item \textit{ORB}\cite{ORB} - Oriented FAST\cite{FAST} and rotated BRIEF is a feature detector and binary descriptor extractor. It is based on FAST key point detector and modified BRIEF. In this algorithm the problem of images rotations has been solved and it is supposed to work well. Because of its ability to fast computing the algorithm seems to be appropriate to use for real-time applications. Considering described features of BRIEF we found it to be relevant for our goal.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Postprocessing}

Between features extraction and classifier learning, extracted data are required to be processed and improved to become more reliable. For this step, 2 kinds of normalization has been implemented as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Normalize} \cite{PREPROCESSING}  - rescales the vector for each sample to have unit norm, independently of the distribution of the samples.
	
	\item \textit{Standard Scaler} \cite{PREPROCESSING}  - removes the mean and scales the data to unit variance. However, the outliers have an influence when computing the empirical mean and standard deviation which shrink the range of the feature values. Standard Scaler unfortunately cannot guarantee balanced feature scales in the presence of outliers.
\end{itemize}

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Postprocessing.png}
	\caption{Posteprocessing data flow}
	\label{fig:Posteprocessing}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Learning}

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a set of related methods for supervised learning, applicable to both classification and regression problems. A SVM classifiers creates a maximum-margin hyperplane that lies in a transformed input space and splits the example classes, while maximizing the distance to the nearest cleanly split examples. The parameters of the solution hyperplane are derived from a quadratic programming optimization problem\cite{SVM1}. In this research methods has been used as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item vector - classifier learns with usage of vector of descriptors retrieved from picture and the information about correct letter on the image. 
This method has a significant disadvantage. Vectors received by the classifier must have exactly the same length which as a consequence extorts cutting the longer ones and ignoring too short ones.
	
	\item points - classifier learns by processing descriptor after descriptor and the information about related letter form picture. This way of learning makes the algorithm independent from data vector length.
	
	\item combined - the output from both vector and points classifiers are taken into consideration. Classifier learns by taking those outputs and the information about correct answer.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{EXPERIMENT}

\subsection{Data sets}
	In this experiment two different data sets has been used. The first one has been downloaded from the website of Silesian University of Technology[czy tu powinien byc odnosnik do tego zbioru?]. It consists of 899 images of gestures from American aplhabet form A to Y excluding J. Letters 'Z' and 'J' are moving gestures and it is impossible to show them on single picture. This data set contains images with uncontrolled background and lightning conditions, different angle of hand rotations form observer perspective and different resolution. Images are oriented both vertically and horizontally.
	
	The second data set used in the experiment is a self-made set of images which has been created in possibly similar lightning condition. On each image only hands at uniform, plain background has been shown. Each image has exactly the same, high resolution and all of them are oriented horizontally. The set contains images of gestures of all American sign alphabet also with 'J' and 'Z' excluded.

\section{RESULTS}

During the research the successive steps has been added to the algorithm. As a result, at some steps we decided to abandon working with some feature extractors because of their unsatisfying accuracy in comparison to the others. The table containing the results has been presented below.
